      # Early returns

      I don't think this is possible in regular Haml,
      but it makes sense to do it in Mayu.

      ```haml
      :ruby
        def self.get_initial_state(**)
          { clicked: false }
        end
        def handle_click(_event)
          update(clicked: true)
        end
      - if state[:clicked]
        - return
          %p You clicked the button.
      %button(onclick=handle_click) Click me
      ```

      ## Future ideas

      It would definitely be possible to extend the syntax a little bit more,
      something like this would be cool:

      ```haml
      - return unless props[:data]
        %p Loadingâ€¦
      %pre= props[:data]
      ```

      Note that it doesn't work yet.
